# Individual Module Cross-Module Dependencies - FIXED! âœ…

## Problem Solved

The cross-module dependency system now works from **any directory level**, including individual module directories. Previously, cross-module dependencies only worked when building from the `modules/` directory.

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Issue):
```bash
cd modules/probe_driver/
make compile
# ERROR: unit "clk_divider_core" not found in library "work"
```

### After (Fixed):
```bash
cd modules/probe_driver/
make compile
# SUCCESS: probe_driver_top.vhd compiles with clk_divider_core reference
```

## Technical Solution

### Root Cause
When building from individual module directories, the `compile-local` target was using separate work libraries, so dependent modules couldn't access shared module entities.

### Solution: Unified Work Library for Individual Modules
Modified the `compile-local` target to:
1. **Delegate to modules directory**: Change to `modules/` directory for compilation
2. **Use unified work library**: Compile into the same work library as the all-modules build
3. **Build dependencies first**: Ensure shared modules are compiled before dependent modules

### Implementation
```makefile
# Compile a specific module (local version to avoid recursion)
compile-local:
	@echo "Compiling module with dependency support..."
	@echo "Using unified work library from modules directory..."
	@cd $(MODULES_ROOT) && $(MAKE) compile-single-module MODULE_NAME=$(MODULE_NAME)
```

## Verification

### Work Library Contents
Both modules are now in the unified work library:
```
clk_divider_core at 5( 138) + 0 on 37;
probe_driver_top at 11( 437) + 0 on 52;
```

This proves that `probe_driver_top.vhd` successfully compiled with its reference to `clk_divider_core`.

## Usage Examples

### âœ… All Directory Levels Now Work:

```bash
# Build all modules with dependencies
cd modules/
make compile

# Build individual module with dependencies  
cd modules/probe_driver/
make compile

# Build individual shared module
cd modules/clk_divider/
make compile

# Build from testbench directory (delegates to parent)
cd modules/probe_driver/tb/
make compile
```

### âœ… Cross-Module References Work Everywhere:

```vhdl
-- In probe_driver/top/probe_driver_top.vhd
CLK_DIVIDER: entity work.clk_divider_core
    port map (
        clk => Clk,
        rst_n => not Reset,
        div_sel => cfg_clk_div_sel,
        clk_en => clk_en_internal,
        stat_reg => stat_clk_div
    );
```

## Benefits

### âœ… **Consistent Behavior**
- Cross-module dependencies work from any directory level
- Same unified work library approach everywhere
- No more "works from modules/ but not from module/" issues

### âœ… **Developer Experience**
- Can work in individual module directories
- Dependencies automatically resolved
- No need to remember to build from modules/ directory

### âœ… **Maintains Architecture**
- General-purpose modules (clk_divider) remain standalone
- Dependent modules can reference shared modules
- Clean separation of concerns

## Architecture

```
modules/
â”œâ”€â”€ work-obj08.cf              # Unified work library (shared by all builds)
â”œâ”€â”€ clk_divider/               # Shared module
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core/clk_divider_core.vhd
â””â”€â”€ probe_driver/              # Dependent module
    â””â”€â”€ top/probe_driver_top.vhd  # References clk_divider_core
```

## Build Process

### Individual Module Build:
1. **Change to modules/**: Ensures unified work library
2. **Build shared modules**: Compiles clk_divider first
3. **Build target module**: Compiles probe_driver with access to clk_divider_core
4. **Result**: Cross-module dependency resolved

### All Modules Build:
1. **Build shared modules**: Compiles clk_divider first  
2. **Build dependent modules**: Compiles probe_driver with access to clk_divider_core
3. **Result**: Same unified work library, same successful compilation

## Error Handling

The system now gracefully handles:
- **Missing shared modules**: Skips if not found
- **Missing dependencies**: Clear error messages
- **Duplicate definitions**: Warnings (expected from previous builds)
- **Testbench issues**: Separate from cross-module dependency problems

## Future Extensibility

Adding new cross-module dependencies is now simple:
1. **Add to Makefile.deps**: Define shared modules and build order
2. **Reference in VHDL**: Use `entity work.module_name` syntax
3. **Build from anywhere**: Works from any directory level

The cross-module dependency system is now fully functional across all directory levels! ðŸŽ‰
