# 🚀 **TODO: Phase 0D** `DataDefintions`


## 🚀 **Starting Points for Datadefintions:**

To date we have hade great success abstracting away our shared datatypes using the 'datadefs' aproach. That said, I never really  precisely defined what makes a `datadef`.

Our current concept  a `datadef` is more like a python `dataclass` than a traditional `C struct`- that is to say it provides some minimal properties.

a proper datad defintion should __clearly__ define:
	- datastructure widths, valid ranges, 
	- .. more stuff here

### @DEX: Can you analyze the current set of 'datadefintions' and come up with more properties ?

I would like give a more precise set of properties that our `datadefs` approach provides. 
Once we have some clarity I suggest we then write them to a (tentative) 

4. If successful, I would be interested to see if we can 'work backwards' to the current (or perhaps even improve) the existing 'datadefinition' files. 

## ✅ **COMPLETED TASKS**

### **DATADEF Analysis Complete**
- **Analysis Document**: `DATADEF_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive analysis of existing datadef properties
- **Key Findings**: Identified 4 core property categories with specific examples
- **Standardization**: Proposed required vs. optional properties for all datadefs

### **PercentLut Generation Proposal Complete**
- **Proposal Document**: `PERCENTLUT_GENERATION_PROPOSAL.md` - Detailed plan for programmatic generation
- **Approach**: Configuration-driven generation using YAML + VHDL templates
- **Implementation Plan**: 4-phase development with specific deliverables

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
1. **Review Analysis**: Validate the DATADEF properties against your vision
2. **Template Development**: Start creating VHDL generation templates
3. **Proof of Concept**: Generate a simple datadef package as validation

### **Short-term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)**
1. **Generation Engine**: Implement basic VHDL code generation
2. **PercentLut Recreation**: Generate new PercentLut package using templates
3. **Validation**: Test generated package against existing functionality

### **Medium-term Goals (Next Month)**
1. **Template Library**: Expand templates for common datadef patterns
2. **Automation**: Automated Verilog compatibility checking
3. **Standardization**: Apply consistent patterns across existing packages

## 🔍 **Key Insights from Analysis**

### **What Makes a DATADEF**
1. **SYSTEM_* Constants**: Fundamental data widths and sizes
2. **Explicit Type Definitions**: Clear, Verilog-portable data structures
3. **Validation Functions**: Bounds checking and data integrity
4. **Safe Access Patterns**: Bounds-checked data retrieval
5. **Verilog Conversion Documentation**: Clear conversion strategies

### **Current Strengths**
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Comprehensive validation
- ✅ Clear conversion documentation
- ✅ Strong type safety

### **Areas for Improvement**
- 🔄 Standardized function naming
- 🔄 Consistent error handling
- 🔄 Automated generation system
- 🔄 Verilog compatibility verification

## 🚀 **Recommendation**

**Proceed with Template Development**: The analysis shows your existing datadefs are well-structured and follow good patterns. The proposed generation system will standardize these patterns and make future development more efficient.

**Start Simple**: Begin with basic VHDL templates for constants, types, and functions. Validate with a simple datadef package before tackling the full PercentLut recreation.
