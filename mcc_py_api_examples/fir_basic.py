# Moku Example: Basic FIR Filter Builder Configuration ##

# This example demonstrates how to configure the FIR filter builder
# and how to set the frequency, shape, window_functions, and other
# parameters to the filter.

# Then, configure the front end and outputs of the FIR filter.

    # The cutoff frequencies of the filter are defined as a fraction of the sampling rate. For example,
    # if the sample rate is 39.06MHz and the corner frequency is set to 0.1, then the cutoff frequency is 3.906MHz.

    # Sample Rate: 39.06 MHz
    # SR * corner_val = corner_freq

    # 39.06 MHz * 0.1 = 3.906 MHz
    # 39.06 MHz * 0.4 = 15.624 MHz

    # Lowpass filter corner frequency
    f_low = 0.1  # 3.906 MHz

    # Highpass filter corner frequency:
    f_high = 0.4  # 15.624 MHz

    # Bandpass filter low and high corner frequency
    bp_low = 0.1  # 3.906 MHz
    bp_high = 0.4  # 15.624 MHz

    # Bandstop filter low and high corner frequency
    bs_low = 0.1  # 3.906 MHz
    bs_high = 0.4  # 15.624 MHz

    # On Moku:Pro, there are four available channels, but on Moku:Lab and Go, there are only two available channels. The max sample rate
    # for the Moku:Pro is 39.06 MHz, for the Moku:Lab it is 15.63 MHz, and for Moku:Go it is 15.63 MHz. Because of this, the corner
    # frequency calculations will look different depending on the hardware being used.
