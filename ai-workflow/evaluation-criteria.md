# Evaluation Criteria and Grading System

## Primary Metrics (Weighted Scoring)

### 1. Development Speed (30% weight)
**Measurement**: Total time from start to working implementation
- **Excellent (90-100)**: < 2 days
- **Good (80-89)**: 2-3 days  
- **Average (70-79)**: 3-4 days
- **Below Average (60-69)**: 4-5 days
- **Poor (<60)**: > 5 days

**Tracking Method**: 
- Start timer when beginning implementation
- Stop timer when all tests pass and implementation is complete
- Record daily progress milestones

### 2. Code Quality Score (40% weight)
**Components**:
- **Functional Correctness (40%)**: All requirements met, tests pass
- **Standards Compliance (30%)**: Follows VOLO VHDL standards
- **Test Coverage (20%)**: Comprehensive testbench coverage
- **Documentation (10%)**: Clear comments and structure

**Scoring Scale**:
- **Excellent (90-100)**: All tests pass, perfect standards compliance, comprehensive tests
- **Good (80-89)**: Minor issues, mostly compliant, good test coverage
- **Average (70-79)**: Some issues, basic compliance, adequate tests
- **Below Average (60-69)**: Multiple issues, poor compliance, minimal tests
- **Poor (<60)**: Major issues, non-compliant, no tests

### 3. Developer Experience (20% weight)
**Subjective Rating (1-10 scale)**:
- **Clarity**: How clear and understandable was the plan?
- **Usability**: How easy was it to follow during development?
- **Efficiency**: How well did it guide decision-making?
- **Satisfaction**: Overall experience with the planning approach

**Conversion to 100-point scale**: Rating × 10

### 4. Implementation Accuracy (10% weight)
**Measurement**: How closely the result matches original requirements
- **Excellent (90-100)**: Perfect match, all features implemented
- **Good (80-89)**: Minor deviations, all core features present
- **Average (70-79)**: Some missing features, core functionality works
- **Below Average (60-69)**: Missing important features
- **Poor (<60)**: Major functionality missing

## Secondary Metrics (Bonus Points)

### Error Recovery Time
- **Bonus (+5 points)**: < 2 hours total debugging time
- **Neutral (0 points)**: 2-6 hours debugging time
- **Penalty (-5 points)**: > 6 hours debugging time

### Documentation Quality
- **Bonus (+3 points)**: Excellent inline documentation
- **Neutral (0 points)**: Adequate documentation
- **Penalty (-3 points)**: Poor or missing documentation

### Innovation/Insights
- **Bonus (+2 points)**: Discovered improvements or optimizations
- **Neutral (0 points)**: Standard implementation
- **Penalty (-2 points)**: No insights gained

## Grading Rubric

### Overall Score Calculation
```
Total Score = (Speed × 0.30) + (Quality × 0.40) + (Experience × 0.20) + (Accuracy × 0.10) + Bonus - Penalties
```

### Grade Ranges
- **A+ (95-100)**: Exceptional performance across all metrics
- **A (90-94)**: Excellent performance with minor areas for improvement
- **B+ (85-89)**: Good performance with some notable strengths
- **B (80-84)**: Solid performance meeting most expectations
- **C+ (75-79)**: Adequate performance with room for improvement
- **C (70-74)**: Below expectations but functional
- **D (60-69)**: Poor performance with significant issues
- **F (<60)**: Failed to meet basic requirements

## Data Collection Methods

### Quantitative Data
- **Time Tracking**: Start/stop timestamps for each phase
- **Test Results**: Pass/fail counts, coverage metrics
- **Code Metrics**: Lines of code, complexity measures
- **Error Counts**: Compilation errors, runtime errors, test failures

### Qualitative Data
- **Developer Notes**: Daily observations and challenges
- **Plan Effectiveness**: Specific examples of helpful/unhelpful guidance
- **Decision Points**: Where the plan helped or hindered decision-making
- **Frustration Points**: Areas where the plan was unclear or unhelpful

## Comparison Framework

### Side-by-Side Analysis
1. **Direct Metric Comparison**: Speed, quality, experience scores
2. **Qualitative Assessment**: Strengths and weaknesses of each approach
