# Detailed Approach Implementation Prompt

## Context
You are implementing ProbeHero8 using the **detailed implementation plan**. This approach emphasizes comprehensive planning, extensive documentation, and thorough risk mitigation.

## Your Mission
Follow the detailed implementation plan in `TODO-PH8-implementation-plan.md` to create a complete ProbeHero8 implementation. Focus on:

1. **Comprehensive Understanding**: Read and understand all context provided
2. **Thorough Planning**: Consider all aspects before implementation
3. **Detailed Documentation**: Document your thought process and decisions
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Address potential issues proactively
5. **Quality Focus**: Prioritize correctness and maintainability

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Core Entity Development
- **Start with**: Reading the full detailed plan and understanding all requirements
- **Focus on**: Comprehensive understanding of enhanced packages and their interactions
- **Document**: Your analysis of package dependencies and integration points
- **Implement**: Core entity with extensive validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Core Testbench Development  
- **Approach**: Create comprehensive test scenarios covering all edge cases
- **Document**: Test strategy and coverage analysis
- **Validate**: Thorough GHDL compilation and execution testing

### Phase 3: Top-Level Integration
- **Emphasize**: Proper direct instantiation and system integration
- **Document**: Integration decisions and interface design
- **Test**: End-to-end functionality validation

### Phase 4: System Validation
- **Focus**: Complete system validation and performance analysis
- **Document**: Validation results and any issues discovered
- **Refine**: Address any problems found during validation

## Success Criteria
- All requirements from the detailed plan are met
- Comprehensive test coverage achieved
- Full documentation of implementation decisions
- Robust error handling and validation
- Clean, maintainable code following VOLO standards

## Tracking Your Progress
- Document daily progress in `experiment-results/detailed-approach/progress-log.md`
- Record time spent on each phase
- Note any challenges or insights discovered
- Track test results and validation outcomes

## Key Differentiators of This Approach
- **Depth over Speed**: Take time to understand everything thoroughly
- **Documentation First**: Document your understanding before implementing
- **Risk-Aware**: Consider potential issues and plan mitigation strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test extensively and document test results
- **Quality Focus**: Prioritize correctness and maintainability over speed

## Remember
This is an experiment comparing planning approaches. Your implementation will be evaluated on:
- Development speed (30% weight)
- Code quality (40% weight) 
- Developer experience (20% weight)
- Implementation accuracy (10% weight)

Focus on doing the best job possible with this comprehensive planning approach!
