# Checkpoint: Enhanced Moku_Voltage_pkg Complete
## Date: 2025-01-27

## Current Status
- **Branch**: `ai-workflow-datadefs`
- **Last Commit**: `3fb2b5f` - Complete enhanced Moku_Voltage_pkg with unit hinting
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/johnycsh/volo_codes/volo_vhdl`
- **Current Task**: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced Moku_Voltage_pkg implementation

## What We've Accomplished
1. **Enhanced Package Files Created**:
   - `modules/probe_driver/datadef/Moku_Voltage_pkg_en.vhd`
   - `modules/probe_driver/datadef/Moku_Voltage_pkg_en_body.vhd`
   - `modules/probe_driver/tb/datadef/Moku_Voltage_pkg_en_tb.vhd`

2. **Documentation Updated**:
   - `README-ghdl-testbench-tips.md` - Added new VHDL tips and package testing practices

3. **Git Status**:
   - All changes committed and pushed to `ai-workflow-datadefs` branch
   - Ready for pull request

## Technical Achievements
- ✅ Fixed VHDL syntax issues with array types and function parameters
- ✅ Created comprehensive testbench with 14 test cases
- ✅ All tests pass with GHDL compilation and execution
- ✅ Zero synthesis overhead - pure documentation enhancement
- ✅ Enhanced unit hinting throughout package

## Next Phase Ready
The enhanced Moku_Voltage_pkg is complete and ready. The next logical steps would be:
1. Create enhanced versions of remaining datadef packages
2. Apply same enhancement pattern to Global_Probe_Table_pkg, Probe_Config_pkg, PercentLut_pkg
3. Consider automated generation system for future packages

## CLI Commands to Continue
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/johnycsh/volo_codes/volo_vhdl

# Check current status
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Continue with next package enhancement
# (Ready to start Global_Probe_Table_pkg enhancement)
```
